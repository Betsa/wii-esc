= General Parameters =
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| MOT_BRAKE || on/off || Turn on or off break ||
|| READ_CALIBRATION || on/off || Read calibration byte from EEPROM ||
|| F_CPU || int || CPU frequency in Hz ||
|| COMP_PWM || on/off || Turn on complimentary PWM for nFET boards ||

= Power settings =
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| PCT_PWR_MIN || Percent || Minimal power ||

= Startup settings =
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| ENOUGH_GOODIES || int || number of successful electrical rotations before checking RPM. ||
|| RPM_START_MIN_RPM || int || minimal RPM for transition to run ||
|| RPM_STEP_INITIAL, RPM_STEP_MAX || int || initially when there no back EMF, it starts commutation with RPM_STEP_INITIAL speed and accelerates up to RPM_STEP_MAX. For a good start you need to provide enough power to rotate motor (with load) at least at RPM_STEP_INITIAL and motor should be able to produce detectable back EMF somewhere inside this range. ||

= Run settings =
|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| RPM_RUN_MIN_RPM || int || below this RPM BLDC exits from run mode. Currently 2 cases: 1) if current power is lower than PCT_PWR_MAX_STARTUP it goes to startup. 2) if higher - reset ||
